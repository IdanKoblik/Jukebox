    <p>
        A listener is an algorithm that monitors events occurring on a server and responds to specific triggers. It continuously scans for particular activities or changes and executes predefined actions when those events are detected. This allows the server to react dynamically to user interactions, system changes, or other significant occurrences, enhancing functionality and improving user experience. Essentially, listeners help automate responses and streamline processes within the server environment.
